After years of software development, I realized that many projects were not tested properly and there was a need to improve this part of the development cycle. I currently focus on test automation for REST APIs and web applications. Please view my resume for the details of my software development experience and skills. I am currently working on contract assignments that are six months or longer in duration in the Metro Atlanta area."
